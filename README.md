## About Me
I am currently an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.clarkson.edu/">Clarkson University</a> where I teach introductory calculus-based physics, introductory astronomy, and introductory astrophysics. I am also the director of Clarkson's Reynolds Observatory.  My faculty page can be found <a href="https://www.clarkson.edu/people/joshua-thomas">here</a>.

I defended my Ph.D. at the University of Toledo on May 29, 2012. I studied the post-AGB star at the heart of the Red Rectangle nebula. The next phase of my research on the Red Rectangle involves a radiative transfer model of the Red Rectangle nebula. My most active research at the moment has been setting up an LHIRES III spectrograph and photometric setup at Clarkson's Reynolds Observatory. Current astrophysics projects involve binary stars, Be stars, and Wolf-Rayet stars. I have also conducted research in observational spectroscopy, laboratory astrophysics and atomic physics.  

Other research interests lie in using image analysis and python to solve problems.  This has resulted in fruitful collaborations studying dinosaur bones and eggs.

I am also involved in a New York State Ed. funded STEM outreach grant called <a href="https://sites.clarkson.edu/impetus/">IMPETUS</a>.
